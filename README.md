# Delivery Destoyer

This game is a submission for Ludem Dare 53. Theme: "Delivery." My game's adherence to the theme: "Minimal." Ah well.

Your job is to prevent the delivery of a high explosive to the power core of your weapons plant. You do this by delivering heavy weaponry to the delivery area, then said weaponry delivers highly deliverable payloads of dangerous deliverables onto the offending deliverer.

Basically, I wanted to make a tower defense game. But, the little guy that you attack *is* carrying a giant bomb, and everything *does* explode if the little guys successfully complete their delivery.

Buttons on the right side allow you to select which sort of tower you're placing.
Bolt towers (blue) are the standard type, and cost 2 scrap.
Cannon towers (orange) do twice as much damage as the bolt towers, but shoot slightly slower. They cost 4 scrap.
Lance towers (green) have twice the range as the bolt towers, but shoot slightly slower. They cost 4 scrap.
You can also add Armor to your towers. This allows them to withstand one explosion without breaking.

When the little bomb people (LBPs) die, they explode, which destroys an nearby unarmored towers. The longer the game goes on, the better the LBPs get at exploding, running, and not dying.
